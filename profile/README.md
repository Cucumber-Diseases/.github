# Welcome to "Diagnosis and Treatment of Cucumber-Diseases"

This organization hosts a collection of repositories with exercises for a workshop called **"Diagnosis and Treatment of Cucumber Diseases"**. It is designed to help you practice and master the Cucumber-Diseases katas in various programming languages.

## 📚 Available Repositories

Each repository in this organization corresponds to a specific programming language and contains the same set of exercises according to our code smells, or "cucumber diseases".

## 📄 Documentation

You can access the full documentation on our [website](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/), where you'll find all the information you need to get started, troubleshoot issues, and deepen your understanding of BDD and programming best practices.

### 🔧 Installation Guide

To get started with any of the repositories, you'll need to set up your development environment. The [Installation Guide](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/repos/) provides step-by-step instructions on.

### 🦠 Understanding "Cucumber Diseases" (Code Smells)

Code smells, or "cucumber diseases," are patterns in the code that indicate potential problems or areas for improvement. Our [Code Smells Documentation](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/smells/) covers:

- A detailed explanation of common code smells encountered in BDD test suites.
- A description of the impact if present in your tests
- Best practices for diagnosing and addressing these issues to maintain clean, efficient code.

### 📝 Exercise Details

Each programming language repository contains a variety of the same exercises ordered by the code smells. You'll find an exercise section in our [Code Smells Documentation](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/smells/).

## 🗣 Community and Support

Join the conversation! If you have questions, need help with an exercise, or want to discuss solutions, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion in the repository.

## 📄 License
