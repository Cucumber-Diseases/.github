# Welcome to Cucumber-Diseases

Welcome to the Cucumber-Diseases GitHub organization! This organization hosts a collection of repositories with exercises designed to help you practice and master the Cucumber-Diseases katas in various programming languages.

## 📚 Available Repositories

Each repository in this organization corresponds to a specific programming language and contains a set of exercises ranging from basic to advanced levels. Below in the organisation there is a list of available repositories.

## 📄 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available to guide you through the installation process, explain the common code smells (what we refer to as "cucumber diseases"), and provide detailed information about the exercises. This documentation is designed to help you make the most of the resources in our repositories.

### 🔧 Installation Guide

To get started with any of the repositories, you'll need to set up your development environment. The [Installation Guide](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/repos/) provides step-by-step instructions on:

- Setting up the necessary tools and dependencies for each programming language.
- Configuring your IDE or text editor with Git integration and your preferred BDD tools.
- Cloning repositories and running your first exercise.

### 🦠 Understanding "Cucumber Diseases" (Code Smells)

Code smells, or "cucumber diseases," are patterns in the code that indicate potential problems or areas for improvement. Our [Code Smells Documentation](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/smells/) covers:

- A detailed explanation of common code smells encountered in BDD test suites.
- A description of the impact if present in your tests
- Examples of these code smells in different programming languages.
- Best practices for diagnosing and addressing these issues to maintain clean, efficient code.

### 📝 Exercise Details

Each programming language repository contains a variety of exercises that are categorized by difficulty and topic. The [Exercise Details](https://yourwebsite.com/exercises) section of our documentation includes:

- A breakdown of the exercises available in each repository.
- Detailed descriptions of what each exercise is designed to teach.
- Tips and hints to help you solve the exercises.
- Links to additional resources for further learning.

### 🌍 Accessing the Documentation

You can access the full documentation on our [website](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/), where you'll find all the information you need to get started, troubleshoot issues, and deepen your understanding of BDD and programming best practices.
