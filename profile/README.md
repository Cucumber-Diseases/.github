# Welcome to Cucumber-Diseases

This organization hosts a collection of repositories with exercises designed to help you practice and master the Cucumber-Diseases katas in various programming languages.

## 📚 Available Repositories

Each repository in this organization corresponds to a specific programming language and contains a set of exercises ranging from basic to advanced levels. Below in the organisation there is a list of available repositories.

## 📄 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available to guide you through the installation process, explain the common code smells (what we refer to as "cucumber diseases"), and provide detailed information about the exercises. You can access the full documentation on our [website](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/), where you'll find all the information you need to get started, troubleshoot issues, and deepen your understanding of BDD and programming best practices.

### 🔧 Installation Guide

To get started with any of the repositories, you'll need to set up your development environment. The [Installation Guide](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/repos/) provides step-by-step instructions on.

### 🦠 Understanding "Cucumber Diseases" (Code Smells)

Code smells, or "cucumber diseases," are patterns in the code that indicate potential problems or areas for improvement. Our [Code Smells Documentation](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/smells/) covers:

- A detailed explanation of common code smells encountered in BDD test suites.
- A description of the impact if present in your tests
- Best practices for diagnosing and addressing these issues to maintain clean, efficient code.

### 📝 Exercise Details

Each programming language repository contains a variety of the same exercises ordered by the code smells. You'll find an exercise section in our [Code Smells Documentation](https://cucumber-diseases.github.io/smells/).

## 🗣 Community and Support
